## [Unreleased]
### Changed
 - Gordon surfaces can be created now without the need to duplicate curves in case of closed surfaces.
   This should make it much easier to integrate into CAD tools.
   __Note__: this is optional. The previous behavior still works.
   Thanks: @Shkolik 🙏

### Added
### Fixed
 - Fixed gradient computation in B-spline intersection. This should improve
   robustness and convergence of the intersection computation.
   Thanks: @gongfan99 🙏
   @joergbrech, @AntonReiswich: Tagging you here. You might need to include this into TiGL / geoml.
